# üöÄ Publish PhotoKik to Google Play Store NOW

## You DON'T Need Android Studio Working!

Your app is 100% ready for Google Play Store. Here's exactly what to do:

## üéØ Two Ways to Get Your APK/AAB Files

### Option 2: Try Local Build (If You Want)

```bash
cd android
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Files will be at:
