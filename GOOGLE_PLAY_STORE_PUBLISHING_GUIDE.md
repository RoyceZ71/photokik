## üéØ Two Publishing Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - No Android Studio Required)

I can set up automated APK building using GitHub Actions. You just push code changes and get built APKs automatically.

**Benefits:**
- No need for Android Studio to work locally
- Automated building in the cloud
- Always produces clean, release-ready APKs
- No local Java/Android SDK requirements

### Option 2: Manual APK Build (If you want to try locally)

If you still want to build locally, here are the exact commands:

```bash
cd android
# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# APK will be at: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## üîê App Signing

For Google Play, you'll need to sign your APK. Two options:

### Option A: Let Google Play Sign (Recommended)
1. Upload unsigned APK to Play Console
2. Enroll in Google Play App Signing
3. Google handles all signing automatically
4. Easiest and most secure option

### Option B: Self-Sign
1. Generate keystore file
2. Sign APK with your key
3. Upload signed APK
4. You manage the signing key

I recommend Option A for simplicity.
