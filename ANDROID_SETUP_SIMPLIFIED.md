# PhotoKik Android Studio Setup - SIMPLIFIED

## ⚡ Quick Setup (Follow These Steps Exactly)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
1. **Install Java JDK 11 or 17** (NOT JDK 8, it's outdated)
   - Download from: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
   - Choose JDK 11 or JDK 17 (LTS versions)
   - **RESTART YOUR COMPUTER** after installation

2. **Install Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Follow installation wizard
   - Let it install the Android SDK

### Step 2: Prepare Project
1. **First, build the web assets:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **If you have Capacitor CLI, sync the project:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```
   
   **OR if that fails, skip it** - the project is already configured!

### Step 3: Open in Android Studio
1. Launch Android Studio
2. Click **"Open"** (NOT "Import Project")
3. Navigate to your PhotoKik folder
4. **Select the `android` folder** (inside PhotoKik, not the root folder)
5. Click "OK"

### Step 4: First-Time Setup
1. **Wait for Gradle Sync** (this can take 5-10 minutes the first time)
2. If Android Studio prompts to update Gradle, click "Don't remind me again"
3. If asked about Google Analytics, you can decline
4. **If sync fails**, try these in order:
   - File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
   - Build → Clean Project
   - Build → Rebuild Project
   - File → Invalidate Caches and Restart

### Step 5: Run the App
1. **Set up a device:**
   - **Physical Phone:** Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging
   - **Emulator:** Tools → AVD Manager → Create Virtual Device (Pixel 6, API 34)

2. **Run the app:**
   - Click green "Run" button (▶️)
   - Select your device
   - Wait for build and installation

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### "JDK Not Found" or "JAVA_HOME" Error
- Install JDK 11 or 17 (not JDK 8)
- Restart your computer
- In Android Studio: File → Project Structure → SDK Location → set JDK

### "Gradle Sync Failed"
1. Check internet connection
2. File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
3. Build → Clean Project → Rebuild Project
4. File → Invalidate Caches and Restart

### "Module not found" Errors
- This is normal if Capacitor plugins aren't fully set up
- The app will still build and run
- Run `npx cap sync android` to fix properly

### "Device Not Found"
- Enable USB Debugging on your phone
- Try different USB cable
- Create an emulator instead

### "Build Failed"
- Make sure you ran `npm run build` first
- Check that `android/app/src/main/assets/public/index.html` exists
- Clean and rebuild project

## 📱 What You'll See

Once working, you'll see:
- PhotoKik splash screen with purple gradient
- Main app with swipe interface
- Camera button to add photos
- Navigation tabs at bottom (mobile) or top (desktop)

## 🎯 Project Structure
```
PhotoKik/
├── android/          ← Open THIS in Android Studio
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── src/main/
│   │   │   ├── assets/public/  ← Web app files

├── src/              ← Your React app source
├── dist/             ← Built web assets
└── package.json
```

## ✅ Success Indicators
- Gradle sync completes without errors
- You can see "PhotoKik" in the project structure
- Build → Make Project works
- App runs on device/emulator

---

**Need help?** The app is already configured to work standalone. If Capacitor commands fail, that's OK - the Android project will still build and run!
