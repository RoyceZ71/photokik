# Push PhotoKik to GitHub - Step by Step

## Prerequisites
- Have Git installed on your computer
- Have a GitHub account (free account works fine)

## Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the green "New" button (or the + icon → "New repository")
3. Repository name: `photokik` (or whatever you prefer)
4. Description: `PhotoKik - Smart Photo Management App`
5. Set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Actions)
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" 
7. **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
8. **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"
9. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Push Your Code
Open Terminal/Command Prompt in your PhotoKik project folder and run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make first commit
git commit -m "Initial PhotoKik Android app commit"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/photokik.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: If You Already Have a GitHub Repository

```bash
# In your PhotoKik folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "PhotoKik Android app ready for Play Store"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your PhotoKik files including:
   - `android/` folder with all the Android code
   - `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` (the build automation)
   - `src/` folder with your React app
   - All the documentation files

## Step 4: Run GitHub Actions Build
1. In your GitHub repository, click the "Actions" tab
2. Click on "Build Android APK" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Choose "release" build type
5. Click the green "Run workflow" button
6. Wait 5-10 minutes for build to complete
7. Download your APK and AAB files from the "Artifacts" section

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Permission denied (publickey)" Error
Use HTTPS instead of SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/photokik.git
```

### "Repository not found" Error
- Make sure the repository name matches exactly
- Make sure you're using your correct GitHub username
- Make sure the repository is public

### "Failed to push" Error
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

### Git Not Installed
**Windows:** Download from https://git-scm.com/
**macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
**Linux:** `sudo apt install git`

## What Happens Next

1. ✅ Your code is safely on GitHub
2. ✅ GitHub Actions automatically builds your APK/AAB files
3. ✅ You get production-ready files for Google Play Store
4. ✅ No Android Studio required!

## Files You'll Get from GitHub Actions

- `photokik-release-apk` → APK file for testing
- `photokik-release-aab` → AAB file for Google Play Store upload
- Build artifacts are stored for 90 days

---

## Next Steps After GitHub Upload

1. **Run the GitHub Actions build** (takes 5-10 minutes)
2. **Download the AAB file** 
3. **Follow PUBLISH_NOW_QUICK_START.md** to upload to Google Play Store
4. **Your app goes live!**

This approach completely bypasses Android Studio and builds your app in the cloud. Much more reliable!
