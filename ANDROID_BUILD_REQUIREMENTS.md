# Android Build Requirements Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Missing Drawable Resource ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: PhotoProcessingService referenced `R.drawable.ic_launcher_foreground` which didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created `/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` with proper camera icon vector drawable
- **Also Fixed**: Updated notification icons to use `R.mipmap.ic_launcher` instead

### 2. AndroidManifest.xml Structure ✅ VERIFIED
Your AndroidManifest.xml is properly structured with:
- All required permissions for camera and storage access
- Proper activity, service, and provider declarations
- Correct file provider configuration
- Valid theme and resource references

### 3. Gradle Permissions ✅ FIXED
- Made gradlew executable with proper permissions

## Remaining Issue: Java Installation Required

### Problem:
The Android build system requires Java 17 (OpenJDK) to be installed on your system.

### Error Seen:
```
ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.
```

### Solution:
Install OpenJDK 17 on your system:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
```

**Windows:**
1. Download OpenJDK 17 from https://adoptium.net/
2. Install and add to PATH
3. Set JAVA_HOME environment variable

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install openjdk@17
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
```

After installing Java, your Android build should work properly.

## Files Fixed:
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml` - Created missing drawable
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/java/com/mocha/photokik/service/PhotoProcessingService.kt` - Fixed notification icon references
- ✅ `android/gradlew` - Made executable

Your AndroidManifest.xml and project structure are correct - you just need Java installed to build the project.
