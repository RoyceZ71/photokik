# PhotoKik - Gradle Sync Fix Guide

## Problem Fixed
The error "Project with path ':capacitor-android' could not be found" has been resolved by making the project completely standalone.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Updated build.gradle Dependencies
- Removed project references to Capacitor modules
- Added direct Maven dependencies for Capacitor plugins
- Made the project work without node_modules folder

### 2. Simplified settings.gradle
- Removed conditional project inclusions
- Project no longer depends on node_modules structure

### 3. Fixed Java Home Configuration
- Added better documentation in gradle.properties
- Provided examples for different operating systems

## How to Fix Java Home Error

If you still get "Java home supplied is invalid" error:

### Option 1: Set JAVA_HOME Environment Variable
1. **Find your JDK installation:**
   ```bash
   java -version
   where java  # Windows
   which java  # macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Set JAVA_HOME environment variable:**
   - **Windows:** Control Panel → System → Advanced → Environment Variables
     - Add: `JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-24`
   - **macOS/Linux:** Add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
     - `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk`

### Option 2: Set Direct Path in gradle.properties
1. Open `android/gradle.properties`
2. Find the line: `# org.gradle.java.home=`
3. Uncomment and set your JDK path:
   ```properties
   org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-24
   ```

## Test the Fix
1. **Restart computer** (important for environment variables)
2. Open Android Studio
3. Open the `android` folder in your PhotoKik project
4. Wait for Gradle sync
5. Should complete successfully!

## Project Structure Now
The project is now completely self-contained:
- No dependency on node_modules
- All Capacitor plugins loaded from Maven
- Works immediately after download
- No need for `npm install` or Capacitor CLI

---

✅ Your PhotoKik project should now sync successfully in Android Studio!
